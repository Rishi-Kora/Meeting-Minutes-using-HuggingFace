# Meeting-Minutes-using-HuggingFace
Generate professional meeting minutes from audio recordings using state-of-the-art models from [Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/).

## Project Overview

This project uses a real-world example (Denver City Council meeting) to demonstrate how to transcribe and summarize audio into concise meeting minutes. It combines speech-to-text and natural language summarization using Hugging Face models.
